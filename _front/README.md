here ist the front end

one subdir for each front end

to run both server and frontend locally:
in terminal:
- after installing flask (pip install flask --user)
- cd tnt
- python flask_app.py
(when files are added or even sometimes when changed, need to stop server CtrlC and restart it!)

to use front_x, 
- browse to localhost:5000/x/
- if live server extension is installed (vs code), can start self-reloading browser from vs code with GoLive in status bar

see flask_app.py to update routes

in flask_app.py right now there are so many routes, maybe it can be streamlined to just 1 route per front end
