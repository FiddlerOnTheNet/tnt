# Triumph and Tragedy Board Game

Here we aim to implement the game Triumph and Tragedy for entertainment and research.

At the moment, the backend is being implemented using Python 3. The API is designed to allow development of AI agents (using search or reinforcement learning), and to facilitate some graphical frontend. The frontend (including gui) may be implemented using JavaScript (for web) or TkInter (for desktop).

## Note on Information

This repo only contains game specific information from publically available files on boardgamegeek.com. Other information (such as a list of all cards) will not be included, and instead will be generated from scratch.
